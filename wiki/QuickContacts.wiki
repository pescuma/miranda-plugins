On pressing an user defined hotkey an dialog pops up where you can enter a contacts name or select it from a combobox and send it messages/files/urls an look at his details.

This is a mod of the Hotkey plugin by micron-x

To be able to set the hotkey you need clist_modern (or some other that implements Hotkeys2), Hotkeys+, HotkeyService or Miranda 0.8

Available hotkeys:
 * Ctrl-V: Make a voice call
 * Ctrl-F: Send file
 * Ctrl-U: Send URL
 * Ctrl-I: Show userinfo
 * Ctrl-H: Open history
 * Ctrl-M: Open contact menu
 * User defined: Open hotkey dialog
In Miranda 0.8 all this keys can be configured in options.
