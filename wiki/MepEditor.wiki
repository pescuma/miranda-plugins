#summary Mep Editor description

= Mep Editor =

This is an editor of mep (Miranda Emoticon Pack) files. Mep files are packs with a list of images to be used for the emoticons.


=== Install ===

Donwload it from the Downloads tab, create a folder somewere in your HD and extract the contents of the zip inside it. To run, execute the _MepEditor.bat_ file.

You will need a Java 6 installed on your machine and in your path in order to run it.

Be warned that it is single thread by now, so it is somewhat slow now (it is a concern only when downloading images or opening a lot of images at the same time).


=== Using it ===

To use it, follow these steps:

  # Create a folder with the pack name
  # Copy all images inside that folder. If an image is only for one protocol, create a folder (inside the pack folder) with the protocol name and copy it inside
  # Run Mep Editor. When it asks for the path, provide the one created in step 1
  # Select in the _Icon:_ combo the image to be used for the emoticons
  # If the image is an animated gif, select in _Frame:_ which frame should be used in the selection window

The emoticon show in the left of the emoticon name is the default emoticon (from Tango pack), and can be used as a basis to compare your files.
