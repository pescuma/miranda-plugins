*CAUTION: THIS IS ALPHA QUALITY SOFTWARE. IT CAN ERASE ALL YOUR HISTORY. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.*

This is a plugin that logs to a text file all messages exchanged with contact. The text file is encoded in UTF-8. It can't handle group chat. 

This plugin requires at least Miranda 0.7 and needs History Events to work.
