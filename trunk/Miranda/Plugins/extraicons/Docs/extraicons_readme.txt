Extra Icons Service plugin
--------------------------

CAUTION: THIS IS A BETA STAGE PLUGIN. IT CAN DO VERY BAD THINGS. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.


This is a simple plugin to allow the user to select which extra icons he wants to see.

It is based on the idea that plugins register icons, the contact list shows them, and this plugin is the glue. By default it supports:
 - Account
 - E-mail
 - Phone/SMS
 - Homepage
 - Visibility
 - Chat activity
 - Gender

By now it is supported my clist_modern and clist_mw from 0.8#29. I intend to add clist_nicer next.

Thanks to FYR for some code that I copied from clist_modern and to Angeli-Ka for the nice icons.
