Based on Miranda Icon Builder by Art Fedorov


The overlay names have to be:
offline.ico
online.ico
away.ico
dnd.ico
na.ico
occupied.ico
freechat.ico
invisible.ico
onthephone.ico
outtolunch.ico


And the protocol icons have to be
	<protocol name>.ico


If you want, for some status, to not use the overlay, create an icon
	<protocol name>-<overlay name>.ico
inside the protos folder


Case matters!
